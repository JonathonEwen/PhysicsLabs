I have included 3 physics labs that I did during my time in the department of physics. I am very proud of this work and I believe it demonstrates 
my critical thinking and analysis abilities as well as anything. Full details on the setup and purpose of each experiment as well as all data
can be found in the reports and associated excel files.
